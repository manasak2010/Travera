A camera inside your car for better travel vlogging and image capturing.

We will use a two-faced camera or two individual cameras facing towards opposite directions inside the desk of a car  that captures images as desired by the driver or user and stores them in the cloud for later use. It may essentially be used for blogging and hands-free video-making while driving, hence reducing accidents.  

In this project we mainly focus on three phases:
a) Capturing videos and images with the attached camera.
b) Automation of importing videos and images to the cloud (firebase).
c) Automating the machine to compile the images and videos to produce a movie.

PHASE ONE:
- In this phase, images, and videos are captured by the camera attached on the desk of the car.
- User can easily take pictures or videos using the buttons on the steering wheel.
- Code has been written and implemented in order to capture the aforementioned images and videos. 

PHASE TWO:
- The media captured by the cameras is stored in SD cards inserted in it.
- The data is stored in local storage(SD Card) first and then sent to the cloud(firebase).

PHASE THREE:
- In the third phase we focus on data files of images and videos taken in the car and store them in the firebase.
- For security purposes, the media stored in the local storage is uploaded to the cloud.
- Data uploaded on the cloud gives the user access to it anywhere at any time.

PHASE FOUR:
- To enhance passenger's travel experience, The AI machine compiles all the photos and videos into a movie.
